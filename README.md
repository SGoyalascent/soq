SOQ - Stack Overflow Questions
------------------------------

A repository of material related to Stack Overflow
(http://stackoverflow.com/) questions and answers.

Currently (2016-07-01) undergoing reconstruction or reorganization so
that material for separate questions has its own directory.

For the time being, directory names are written as so-abcd-wxyz (e.g.
so-3333-8314), and will be placd in the src directory.  The inc
directory contains common headers (but the source for them is in src/libsoq
and src/libcs50 or other locations as appropriate).  The lib directory contains a
compiled library of common code (but the source for it is in src/libsoq and libcs50).
The etc directory contains miscellaneous files, such as the common
makefile control information.
