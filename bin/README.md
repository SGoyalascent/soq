# `bin` Directory

Apart from the README.md file (and .gitignore file), this is a
destination directory for binaries (compiled C programs, etc) and for
the 'compiled' versions of shell scripts (or any other scripting
language).
There shouldn't be any source code in here.

The source code for the scripts is in `src/scripts`; compilation copies
the scripts (without the language-identifying suffix) to this directory.

The directory content should be ignored except for the README.md file.
