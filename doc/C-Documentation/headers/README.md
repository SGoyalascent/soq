# Create and Include Header Files

This was a documentation topic under the C section.
The material was largely prepared by me.

With the retirement of Documentation (2017-08-08), this material was
preserved elsewhere.

The sections to read are (in sequence):

* [Introduction](introduction.md)
* [Self-containment](self-containment.md)
* [Idempotence](idemtpotence.md)
* [Minimality](minimality.md)
* [Notation and Miscellany](notation.md)
* [Include What You Use (IWYU)](iwyu.md)
