# C â€” Undefined References and how to fix them

This contains drafts of what might become a C FAQ on 'undefined
references'.
See SO chat room [C Undefined
References](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/152916/c-undefined-references).
The triggering question was [Source file is required to include instead
of header](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45899270).
The question contains some links to the chat room, the C++ question,
etc, and the chat room contains a link to a Google Sheet, etc.

The discussion also proposes creating an SO tag `[c-faq]` parallel to
the existing `[c++-faq]` tag.
This should be created and applied to selected questions.
It needs wiki information, of course.
