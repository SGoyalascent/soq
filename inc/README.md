# Header directory

I use 3-letter directories for src, bin, etc, tmp, lib â€” I've never seen a good reason not to use inc rather than include.

This directory contains 'released' headers.
Headers from the library source directory are installed here when they're ready for general use.

The directory should be ignored apart from the README.md file.
