<h1>SOQ - Stack Overflow Questions</h1>

A repository of material related to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"> Stack
Overflow</a>
questions and answers, primarily
those where <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"> Jonathan
Leffler </a>
has
contributed.
This is by no means a complete list of the questions or answers
contributed; these are just the more interesting ones where some part of
the contribution was placed under version control.
</p>

<p>
Note that some questions have been deleted and therefore users with less
than 10K of Stack Overflow reputation will not be able to see the
referenced question.
</p>

<p>
As of 2016-08-20, the repository is mostly stable.
Most of the material is present with a separate source directory for each
question, such as <code>src/so-3567-8399</code>.
There are some exceptions to this in the src directory, with composite
directories containing code related to multiple SO questions, or no SO
question at all.
</p>

<p>
For the time being, the directory name for an answer to SO question
number abcdwxyz is saved in <code>src/so-abcd-wxyz</code> (e.g. the code for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/33338314"> SO
3333-8314 </a>
is in the directory
<code>src/so-3333-8314</code>).
Note that SO does not recognize the punctuation in the number.
</p>

<p>
The <code>inc</code> top-level directory is the directory where common headers are
installed (but the source for them is in <code>src/libsoq</code> and <code>src/libcs50</code>
or other locations as appropriate).
Similarly, the <code>lib</code> top-level directory contains the installed
libraries of common code (but the source for it is in <code>src/libsoq</code> and
<code>src/libcs50</code>).
The headers and libraries are installed by running <code>make install</code> in the
relevant source directories.
</p>

<p>
The <code>etc</code> directory contains miscellaneous files, such as the common
makefile control information and also <a href="http://valgrind.org/"> <code>valgrind</code> </a>
suppressions file for Mac OS X 10.11.6.
