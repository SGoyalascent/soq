# Packages

This directory contains some packages that I've created under different VCS systems than Git.
They're release tar files, usually.

### `daemonize`

The code for a program that, like programs such as `nice` or `sudo` or
`nohup`, changes some properties before running another program
specified on the command line.

In this case, it runs the program as a daemon, whether the process was
expecting it or not.

    Usage: daemonize [-abchptxV][-d dir][-e err][-i in][-o out][-P pidfile][-s sigs][-k fds][-m umask] command [args...]
