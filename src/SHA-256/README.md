### SHA-1 and RFC 4634

This code is directly copied from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634 or
https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4634.txts - no originality of any sort is
claimed for it.

It supports 160, 224, 256, 384, 512 bit hashes, and HMAC too.

The code is probably reliable; it is unlikely to be the fastest possible.
