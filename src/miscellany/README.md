### The Miscellany Directory

This directory contains multiple programs that have appeared in my SOQ
repository at various times that do not have a simple correspondence
with an SO question.  Either there are many possible questions or no
questions could be found that matched, yet the program was created in a
context that suggests it was related to SO.

* cmpfltint.c:

  As noted, incomplete code based on Dr Dobb's Journal article

* computist-1.c:

  Need to track the origin of the problem (there are more questions).

* computist-2.c:

  Need to track the origin of the problem (there are more questions).

* dec_to_hex.c:

  Assembled in response to questions by Saurabh (look in gmail).
incunabulum.c:

  Need to track down the origin of this (arcane, pre-standard K&R C).

* lcm20.c:

  Least-common multiple of products of numbers up to N.

* map.cpp:

  Print balanced brackets

* quine-c.c

  Quine program in C

* rev.c:

  string reversing algorithms, miscellaneous

* revlist.c:

  Probably not my code, but not clear how to identify who wrote it
  before I hacked it into the shape it is.

* stld.cpp:

  Template-based integer loading and unloading as for C-ISAM, etc.

* test-rename.c:

  Test the rename function
