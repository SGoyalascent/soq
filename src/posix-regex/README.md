### POSIX Regex

Question arrived out of thin air - I assumed it was someone from SO but
subsequent emails suggested maybe not - about POSIX regular expressions.

The data is in `jain.txt`.

The first offering was `jl-sed.sh`.
This finds more lines than the outline code in `1.c` that arrived later
- that limits it to lines containing `[stack]` too.

The code in `1.c` has some obvious issues, but they're also relatively
minor issues.  A decent attempt was made.
