### Stack Overflow Question 0036-7309

[SO 0036-7309](https://stackoverflow.com/q/00367309) &mdash; (deleted)
Which command line commands style do you prefer?

Original question deleted as 'spam', which isn't fair.
It was a poll-type question asked in 2008 when the rules were less
clear.
When it was deleted in 2011, it didn't fit the established modus
operandi for SO, so it was fair to delete it, but not really fair to
classify it as spam.

My answer has been moved to two other questions, of which SO 1081-8443 is
marked as a duplicate of SO 0216-0083 by me.
