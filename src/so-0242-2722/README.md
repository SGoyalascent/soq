### Stack Overflow Question 0242-2722

[SO 0242-2722](https://stackoverflow.com/q/02422722) &mdash;
Rounding integer division (instead of truncating)

The intent is to write up a more general solution than my rather minimal
one already in place but highly up-voted.

However, that requires some working code, and the code isn't yet
working.

The code should probably be a little more conservative in its efforts.
At the moment, it tries all combinations of positive and negative values
for both divisor and dividend (and it should check that the quotient is
correct).
