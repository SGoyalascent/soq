# String Replacement Algorithm

I'm not convinced this is great code, but it works for the simple cases
tested (and one not-so-simple test case).  One problem is the interface,
overwriting the original string.

The over-writing bug (and fix) was reported in comments on the SO
4401870 web page 2016-07-03.
