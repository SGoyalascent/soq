### Stack Overflow Question 1487-8356 and 2880-0127

Two examples of calendar calculation code.

[SO 1487-8356](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14878356) &mdash;
Efficiently calculate leap days

[SO 2880-0127 ](https://stackoverflow.com/q/28800127) &mdash;
Universal formula to calculate the number of days in month

The code nleap() is correct according to comments, but deviates from the
CountLeapDays() function with its loop.

The days in month code includes print statements (as comments) that
explain the calculated values moderately well.
The adaptation for leap years was actually trivial.
