### Stack Overflow Question 2027-1977

[SO 2027-1977](https://stackoverflow.com/q/20271977) &mdash;
Sorting 4 arrays in parallel in C

Somewhat unusual requirement â€” sort 4 arrays in parallel, with the
sort order determined by elements in first array, with second array
doing tie-breaks.

* `so-20271977-core.c`

  In some senses, contains the core ideas, but does not contain a
  main program or test harness.

* `so-20271977.c`

  Contains test harness etc. and compares with selection sort too.
