### Stack Overflow Question 2087-5751

[SO 2087-5751](https://stackoverflow.com/q/20875751) &mdash; (deleted)
Implement "finding the Nth largest number in an array"

Two chunks of code, very similar.

The file `partition-3.c` was recovered during a scan of history; it was
named `find3.c` at one point.
It appears to be a thick pivot variation of the code in `partition-4.c`.

The file `partition-4.c` has been around 'forever'.

The question is deleted.
I invited the OP to correspond via email.
He got a series of programs with poor names (`f3.c`, `f4.c` — these
probably correspond to the two programs here; and `mppsel.cpp` and
`qsel.cpp`).
These could be rescued from Gmail (thread entitled "Stack Overflow
question about Kth Smallest Number".
That also mentions SO 2087-5751, identifying the 'current' question as
SO 2093-8023 (also deleted) — but that contains `mppsel.cpp`,
`qsel.cpp` and `x3.cpp` (it was a C++ question).
