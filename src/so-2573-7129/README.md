### Stack Overflow Question 2573-7129

In-order predecessor in BST of left node is null

A question posted by
[deadman](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1860959/deadman) and deleted
shortly after it was posted.

In a BST, I have to find the in-order predecessor.
Now it is straightforward if there is a left node for the key node.
But if the left node is not there then the in-order predecessor is the first left
ancestor node.
I tried to find on Geeks for Geeks and found:

* http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-predecessor-successor-given-key-bst/

But the code finds predecessor only if left node is there

I also tried Google search: https://www.google.com/search?q=first+left+ancestor+bst

But, I kept getting the solutions for lowest common ancestor.  So, can
anyone tell me how do I find the first left ancestor if there is one?
