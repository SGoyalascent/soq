### Stack Overflow Question 3994-9116

[SO 3994-9116](https://stackoverflow.com/q/39949116) &mdash;
Why is my trie leaking data?

[SO 4997-3644](https://stackoverflow.com/q/49973644) &mdash;
Changing a string without delimiters into corresponding numbers.

The second question was deleted (too broad, abandoned).

It is nevertheless an interesting question.
It requires a trie-based search algorithm â€” most of the other trie
questions stop at building the trie rather than really using it.

For the example in the question "onethousandtwohundredandtwentysix",
there is interesting analysis required.

There was a possible duplicate identified:

* [SO 0007-0161](https://stackoverflow.com/q/70161) &mdash;
How to read values from numbers written as words?

That is an interesting question too; it has some interesting answers.

However, modifying trie-based code to do the job might be a worthwhile
exercise at some point (when everything else is done).
