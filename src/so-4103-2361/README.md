### Stack Overflow Question 4103-2361

[SO 4102-2361](http://stackoverflow.com/q/41032361) &mdash;
Generate values with unique digits

The objective is to generate number with all digits unique.  For
example, 10 counts; 11 does not.  Clearly, all single digits numbers are
OK.  All two-digit numbers that are not a multiple of 11 are OK.  Things
begin to be more stringent in the 100s; none of 110..119 are OK, for
example.

There are multiple programs thet could be sensibly consolidated.
