### tp17.c

Caution: incorrect code.

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        int p, a, b, c;
        // printf("Enter a perimeter: ");
        // scanf("%d", &p);
        for (p = 3; p < 30; p++)
        {
            printf("Triangles with perimeter: %d\n", p);

            for (a = 1; 2 * a < p; a++)
            {
                for (b = (p - a) / 2; (p - 2 * a) > 0 && (p - 2 * b) > 0 && (2 * a + 2 * b - p) > 0; b++)
                {
                    c = p - (a + b);
                    if (a <= b && b <= c)
                        printf("%d, %d, %d\n", a, b, c);
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

The condition `if (a <=b && b <= c)` before the `printf()` for results
is intended to ensure that you only generate each combination of lengths
once.
I noted, for example, with p = 12, you get: (2, 5, 5), (3, 4, 5), (4, 4,
4) as the output.
What I missed though is that with p = 11, adding the condition omits (3,
5, 3) (because the code does not generate (3, 3, 5) for reasons which
elude me).
So, the condition isn't good enough â€” it does eliminate a lot of
duplicate entries (good) but also throws some non-duplicate entries away
(bad).

Consequently, the code should eliminate the condition, which leaves the
program generating a lot of redundant outputs, greatly complicating
output comparisons.

### tp13.c

I also created a closely related program, starting from the same base:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        for (int p = 3; p < 30; p++)
        {
            printf("Triangles with perimeter: %d\n", p);
            for (int a = 1; a <= p / 2; a++)
            {
                for (int b = 1; b + a < p; b++)
                {
                    int c = p - (a + b);
                    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a)
                        continue;
                    if (a <= b && b <= c)
                        printf("%d, %d, %d\n", a, b, c);
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

### Output comparisons

Part of the diff -u output from comparing tp13 and tp17 output is:

     Triangles with perimeter: 11
     1, 5, 5
     2, 4, 5
    -3, 3, 5
    +2, 5, 4
     3, 4, 4
    +3, 5, 3
    +4, 3, 4
    +4, 4, 3
    +4, 5, 2
    +5, 3, 3
    +5, 4, 2
    +5, 5, 1
     Triangles with perimeter: 12
     2, 5, 5
     3, 4, 5
    +3, 5, 4
     4, 4, 4
    +4, 5, 3
    +5, 3, 4
    +5, 4, 3
    +5, 5, 2
     Triangles with perimeter: 13

Looking at the results for a perimeter of 12, it is clear that `tp17` just
generates different permutations.  However, looking at the results for a
perimeter of 11 shows that `tp17` generates (3, 5, 3) and (5, 3, 3) but
not (3, 3, 5) whereas tp13 generates (3, 3, 5) and not the other two
permutations.  However, all the other extra lines in the output from
tp17 in the fragment of output shown are permutations of other lines.
Different output formatting required

The output formats above do not lend themselves to automatic comparison,
so I revised the output to print the perimeter followed by three sides
listed in non-decreasing order.  I therefore added code to `tp17.c` to
sort the sides into non-decreasing order before printing.  There are
probably simpler ways to do it for three elements, but this works.


### tp47.c

    /* SO 4203-5818 - Calculate all triangles with given perimeter */
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    static int int_cmp(const void *va, const void *vb)
    {
        int a = *(int *)va;
        int b = *(int *)vb;
        return (a > b) - (a < b);
    }

    int main(void)
    {
        int p, a, b, c;
        for (p = 3; p < 30; p++)
        {
            for (a = 1; 2 * a < p; a++)
            {
                for (b = (p - a) / 2; (p - 2 * a) > 0 && (p - 2 * b) > 0 && (2 * a + 2 * b - p) > 0; b++)
                {
                    c = p - (a + b);
                    {
                    int d[] = { a, b, c };
                    qsort(d, 3, sizeof(d[0]), int_cmp);
                    printf("%d: %d, %d, %d\n", p, d[0], d[1], d[2]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

### tp43.c

    /* SO 4203-5818 - Calculate all triangles with given perimeter */

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        for (int p = 3; p < 30; p++)
        {
            for (int a = 1; a <= p / 2; a++)
            {
                for (int b = 1; b + a < p; b++)
                {
                    int c = p - (a + b);
                    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a)
                        continue;
                    if (a <= b && b <= c)
                        printf("%d: %d, %d, %d\n", p, a, b, c);
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

(Except for the printing, this is the same as tp13.c.)

### Comparisons

The outputs can now be sorted and compared. The `-u` option for `tp43` is superfluous but symmetric.

    $ tp43 | sort -u -k1n -k2n -k3n -k4n > tp43.out
    $ tp47 | sort -u -k1n -k2n -k3n -k4n > tp47.out
    $ diff tp43.out tp47.out
    $ 

So, the unique outputs are the same, but when you count the differences, there are 390 extra lines in the output from tp47:

    $ tp43 | sort -k1n -k2n -k3n -k4n > tp43-all.out
    $ tp47 | sort -k1n -k2n -k3n -k4n > tp47-all.out
    $ diff tp43-all.out tp47-all.out | diffcount
    deleted 0, inserted 390
    $ wc -l tp4?.out tp4?-all.out
         206 tp43.out
         206 tp47.out
         206 tp43-all.out
         596 tp47-all.out
        1214 total
    $

Just for the record, the files tp43.out, tp47.out, tp43-all.out are identical. Their content is:
