### Stack Overflow Question 4295-4541

[SO 4295-4541](https://stackoverflow.com/q/42954541) &mdash;
Sort only either odd or even numbers from an array

Programs progress numerically in complexity.

* `bsort1` — bubble sort for whole array.
* `bsort2` — adaptation of `bsort1` to sort odd numbers only.
* `bsort3` — trivial adaptation of `bsort2` to sort even numbers only.
* `bsort4` — adaptation of `bsort2` and `bsort3` to sort either parity.
* `bsort5` — non-trivial adaptation of `bsort4` to avoid the O(N) storage penalty, at a non-negligible run-time cost.
