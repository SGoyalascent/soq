### Stack Overflow Question 4305-9874

[SO 4305-9874](http://stackoverflow.com/q/43059874) &mdash;
Composite Predicate of function pointers in C

This code is closely based on [Chris
Dodd](http://stackoverflow.com/users/16406/chris-dodd)'s
[answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/43060435/) â€” or at least, the
initial versions of it were.

The source in pd31.c is a modestly extended version of Chris's code, but
no violence has yet been done to it.
