### Stack Overflow Question 4408-7031

[SO 4408-7031](https://stackoverflow.com/q/44087031) &mdash;
Trying to use pipe to read from/write to another program

The code in `rwpipe53.c` is my answer to the question.

The code in `rwpipe17.c` converts the data structure and code in the
question/answer into almost generic code for communicating two-ways by
pipe between two programs.
