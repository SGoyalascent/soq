Start of answer for SO 4474-5677
Flexible array members can lead to undefined behaviour

----

In principle, I'm not dreadfully concerned about the C99 standard and
its corrigenda; they're not the current standard.
However, the evolution of the specification of flexible array members is
informative.

The C99 standard — ISO/IEC 9899:1999 — had 3 technical corrigenda:

* TC1 released on 2001-09-01 (7 pages),
* TC2 released on 2004-11-15 (15 pages),
* TC3 released on 2007-11-15 (10 pages).

It was TC3, for example, that stated that `gets()` was obsolescent and
deprecated, leading to it being removed from the C11 standard.

The C11 standard — ISO/IEC 9899:2011 — has one technical
corrigendum, but that simply sets the value of two macros accidentally
left in the form _`201ymmL`_ — the values required for
`__STDC_VERSION__` and `__STDC_LIB_EXT1__` were corrected to the value
`201112L`.
(You can see the TC1 — formally "ISO/IEC 9899:2011/Cor.1:2012(en)
Information technology — Programming languages — C TECHNICAL
CORRIGENDUM 1" — at
https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:9899:ed-3:v1:cor:1:v1:en.
I've not worked out how you get a download of it, but it is so simple
that it really doesn't matter very much.

### C99 standard on flexible array members

ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (before TC2) §6.7.2.1 ¶16:

> As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than one
named member may have an incomplete array type; this is called a
_flexible array member_.
With two exceptions, the flexible array member is ignored.
First, the size of the structure shall be equal to the offset of the
last element of an otherwise identical structure that replaces the
flexible array member with an array of unspecified length.<sup>106)</sup>
Second, when a `.` (or `->`) operator has a left operand that is (a
pointer to) a structure with a flexible array member and the right
operand names that member, it behaves as if that member were replaced
with the longest array (with the same element type) that would not make
the structure larger than the object being accessed; the offset of the
array shall remain that of the flexible array member, even if this would
differ from that of the replacement array.
If this array would have no elements, it behaves as if it had one
element but the behavior is undefined if any attempt is made to access
that element or to generate a pointer one past it.

> <sup>126)</sup> The length is unspecified to allow for the fact that
> implementations may give array members different alignments according
> to their lengths.

(This footnote is removed in the rewrite.) 
The original C99 standard included one example:

> ¶17 EXAMPLE Assuming that all array members are aligned the same,
> after the declarations:

>     struct s { int n; double d[]; };
>     struct ss { int n; double d[1]; };

> the three expressions:

>     sizeof (struct s)
>     offsetof(struct s, d)
>     offsetof(struct ss, d)

> have the same value. The structure struct s has a flexible array member d.

> ¶18 If sizeof (double) is 8, then after the following code is executed:

>     struct s *s1;
>     struct s *s2;
>     s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 64);
>     s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 46);

> and assuming that the calls to malloc succeed, the objects pointed to by s1 and s2 behave as if the
identifiers had been declared as:

>     struct { int n; double d[8]; } *s1;
>     struct { int n; double d[5]; } *s2;

> ¶19 Following the further successful assignments:

>     s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 10);
>     s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 6);

> they then behave as if the declarations were:

> and:

>     double *dp;
>     dp = &(s1->d[0]); // valid
>     *dp = 42;         // valid
>     dp = &(s2->d[0]); // valid
>     *dp = 42;         // undefined behavior

> ¶20 The assignment:

>     *s1 = *s2;

> only copies the member n and not any of the array elements. Similarly:

>     struct s t1 = { 0 };          // valid
>     struct s t2 = { 2 };          // valid
>     struct ss tt = { 1, { 4.2 }}; // valid
>     struct s t3 = { 1, { 4.2 }};  // invalid: there is nothing for the 4.2 to initialize
>     t1.n = 4;                     // valid
>     t1.d[0] = 4.2;                // undefined behavior

This material was removed in C11.
The change was not noted and did not need to be noted in TC2 because the
examples are not normative.
But the rewritten material in C11 is informative when studied.

### N983 paper identifying a problem with flexible array members

[N983](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n983.htm)
from the WG14 [Pre-Santa Cruz-2002
mailing](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/pre-SantaCruz-2002.htm)
is the initial statement of a defect report.
It states that some C compilers (citing three) manage to put a FAM
before the padding at the end of a structure.

As I understand it, this report led to the change in TC2, though I have not traced
all the steps in the process.
It appears that the DR is no longer available separately.

TC2 used the wording found in the C11 standard in the normative material.

### C11 standard on flexible array members

So, what does the C11 standard have to say about flexible array members?

> §6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers

> ¶3 A structure or union shall not contain a member with incomplete or
> function type (hence, a structure shall not contain an instance of
> itself, but may contain a pointer to an instance of itself), except
> that the last member of a structure with more than one named member
> may have incomplete array type; such a structure (and any union
> containing, possibly recursively, a member that is such a structure)
> shall not be a member of a structure or an element of an array.

This firmly positions the FAM at the end of the structure — 'the last
member' is by definition at the end of the structure, and this is
confirmed by:

> ¶15 Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the
> units in which bit-fields reside have addresses that increase in the
> order in which they are declared.

> ¶17 There may be unnamed padding at the end of a structure or union.

> ¶18 As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than
> one named member may have an incomplete array type; this is called a
> _flexible array member_.
> In most situations, the flexible array member is ignored.
> In particular, the size of the structure is as if the flexible array
> member were omitted except that it may have more trailing padding than
> the omission would imply.
> However, when a `.` (or `->`) operator has a left operand that is (a

This paragraph contains the change in ¶20 of ISO/IEC
9899:1999/Cor.2:2004(E) — the TC2 for C99;

The data at the end of the main part of a structure containing a
flexible array member is regular trailing padding that can occur with
any structure type.
Such padding can't be accessed legitimately, but can be passed to
library functions etc via pointers to the structure without incurring
undefined behaviour.

The C11 standard contains three examples, but the first and third are
related to anonymous structures and unions rather than the mechanics of
flexible array members.
Remember, examples are not 'normative', but they are illustrative.

Note that this changed between C99 and C11.

Another part of the standard describes this copying behaviour:

> §6.2.6.1 General

In the [C chat room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/54304/c),
I [wrote](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/37895451#37895451) some
information of which this is a paraphrase:

Consider:

    struct fam1 { double d; char c; char fam[]; };

Assuming double requires 8-byte alignment (or 4-byte; it doesn't matter
too much, but I'll stick with 8), then `struct non_fam1a { double d;
char c; };` would have 7 padding bytes after `c` and a size of 16.
Further, `struct non_fam1b { double d; char c; char nonfam[4]; };` would
have 3 bytes padding after the `nonfam` array, and a size of 16.

The suggestion is that the start of `fam` in `struct fam1` can be at offset
9, even though `sizeof(struct fam1)` is 16.
So that the bytes after `c` are not padding (necessarily).

So, for a small enough FAM, the size of the struct plus FAM might still
be less than size of `struct fam`.

The prototypical allocation is:

    struct fam1 *fam = malloc(sizeof(struct fam1) + array_size * sizeof(char));

when the FAM is of type `char` (as in `struct fam1`).
That's a (gross) over-estimate when the offset of fam is less than
`sizeof(struct fam1)`.

### Addressing the question

The question asks:

> 1. By using flexible array members (FAMs) within structure types, are
>    we exposing our programs to the possibility of undefined behavior?
> 2. Is it possible for a program to use FAMs and still be a strictly
>    conforming program?
> 3. Is the offset of the flexible array member required to be at the
>    end of the struct?

> The questions apply to both C99 (TC3) and C11 (TC1).

I believe that if you code correctly, the answers are "No", "Yes", "No".

First, to state the obvious, there are lots of ways of exposing a
program to undefined behaviour (and some of those ways involve
structures with flexible array members) but simply using a FAM does not
mean that the program automatically has (invokes, is exposed to)
undefined behaviour.

C11 §4 Conformance

> ¶5 A _strictly conforming program_ shall use only those features of
> the language and library specified in this International
> Standard.<sup>3)</sup>
> It shall not produce output dependent on any unspecified, undefined,
> or implementation-defined behavior, and shall not exceed any minimum
> implementation limit.

> <sup>3)</sup> A strictly conforming program can use conditional
> features (see 6.10.8.3) provided the use is guarded by an appropriate
> conditional inclusion preprocessing directive using the related macro.
> …

> ¶7 A _conforming program_ is one that is acceptable to a conforming
> implementation.<sup>5)</sup>.

> <sup>5)</sup> Strictly conforming programs are intended to be
> maximally portable among conforming implementations.
> Conforming programs may depend upon nonportable features of a
> conforming implementation.

I don't think there are any features of standard C which, if used in the
way that the standard intends, makes the program not strictly
conforming.
If there are any such, they are related to locale-dependent behaviour.

Question 3 is ambiguous between:

* 3A: Is the offset of the flexible array member required to be equal to
   the size of the structure containing the flexible array member?
* 3B: Is the offset of the flexible array member required to be greater
   than the offset of any prior member of the structure?

The answer to 3A is "No" (witness the C11 example at ¶25, quoted above).

The answer to 3B is "Yes" (witness §6.7.2.1 ¶15, quoted above).
