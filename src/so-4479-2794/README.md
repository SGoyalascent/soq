Why am I doing anything about this?
Because I'm stupid, that's why!

The question on SO has been deleted (so you need 10K to find it).
The OP ws not very reasonable in his attitude.

* `client-20170706.c`
* `server-20170706.c`

  This code corresponds more or less to what was provided by the OP, but
  some was gleaned from email sent to me.

* `cpd-client.c`
* `cpd-server.c`

  This code corresponds to the specification above.

The other code needed from the JLSS canon includes:

* `config.h` â€” this needs to be like the one from $HOME/lib/JL
* `cpd.h`
* `daemonize.c`
* `debug.h`
* `emalloc.c`
* `emalloc.h`
* `errhelp.c`
* `estrdup.c`
* `kludge.h`
* `mkpath.c`
* `mkpath.h`
* `posixver.h`
* `stderr.c`
* `stderr.h`
* `sysstat.h`
* `tcp_accept.c`
* `tcp_connect.c`
* `tcp_listen.c`
* `unp.h`
* `unpv13e.h`

The `.gitignore` file ignores the name `pater-familias` which was used
for testing.
