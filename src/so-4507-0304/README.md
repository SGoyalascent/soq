### Stack Overflow Question 4507-0304

[SO 4507-0304](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45070304) &mdash;
Am I implementing this remove node function for a doubly linked list in C correctly?

Answers:

* `dl59.c` — Original code from question
* `dl61.c` — First solution (combining the 4 alternatives into just one)
* `dl67.c` — Second solution (moving the delete out of the loop)
* `dl71.c` — Third solution (refactoring search, delete into separate functions)
