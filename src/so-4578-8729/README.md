### Stack Overflow Question 4578-8729

[SO 4578-8729](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45788729) &mdash;
A Memory Issue in simple C Program Concerning Char Pointers

Code analyszing words from various texts.
You can find two larger files in soq/src/data-files:

* `alice-in-wonderland-pg19033.txt`
* `maya-angelou-phenomenal-woman.txt`

The code includes the original program, and debunks the OP's claim to
have produced an MCVE.
That code is at least twice as big as an MCVE, and even that can be
reduced further.
