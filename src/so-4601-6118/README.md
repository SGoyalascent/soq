### Stack Overflow Question 4601-6118

[SO 4601-6118](https://stackoverflow.com/q/46016118) &mdash;
C using enum to shorten code

Devious stuff, using an enumeration with the same enumeration constants
as the member names of a structure.
There actually isn't a clash.

* `pw41.c` — C11 code (anonymous union inside a structure)
* `pw73.c` — C99 code (named union)
