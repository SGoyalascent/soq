SO 4638-6600 (also 4638-4349)

Question asked twice.

pth23.c is the first answer posted.

pth47.c is the second answer posted.

It is not clear that either is wholly satisfactory, though both are probably
better than what was there before.  The second program uses a single function
to coordinate the back-and-forth reading.
