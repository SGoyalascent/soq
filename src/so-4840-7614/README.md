### Stack Overflow Question 4808-7614

[SO 4808-7614](https://stackoverflow.com/q/48087614) &mdash;
Perlin Noise function - values way out of range

Code here is direct crib from elsewhere, not a contribution to SO.

The Java file effectively comes from http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/noise/,
and the C code is directly and simply adapted from that Java, except that
the half-initializer is formatted for easier reading.

The error testing code is adapted from the question.
