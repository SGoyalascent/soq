### Stack Overflow Question 4972-0718

[SO 4972-0718](https://stackoverflow.com/q/49720718) &mdash;
How to control mutex lock and unlock?

Various solutions were mooted and more or less acceptable solutions were
proposed.
ONe solution I proposed in comments turned out to have a typo in it (two
`pthread_mutex_lock()` calls on the same mutex, rather than one
`pthread_mutex_lock()` and one `pthread_mutex_unlock()`.
This code was assembled to create an answer covering and demonstrating
the various points.

The shell script is trivial â€” it simply runs the program `pth71` with
the argument `-0` five times, then with `-1`, ..., `-4`, to test each
algorithm five times.

The results recorded in my answer are quite interesting:

    Variant 4: time : 0.005910s  result : 1000   [ 251, 249, 250, 250 ]
    Variant 4: time : 0.006832s  result : 1000   [ 250, 250, 250, 250 ]

It was gratifying to see the first variant 1 result.
The variant 0 ones are intriguing, especially the third result.

* `pth71.c`

  The code posted as an answer

* `pth73.c`

  Code configurable from the command line

        Usage: pth73 [-ht01234][-n threads][-c count][-w width]
          -c count   Maximum value for counter (default 1000)
          -h         Print this help message and exit
          -n threads Number of threads to use (default 4)
          -t         Trace execution (very verbose)
          -w width   Number of digits to print for counts (default 4)
          -0         Use t_function_0 - code from question of SO 4972-0718
          -1         Use t_function_1 - original code from answer by @snr
          -2         Use t_function_2 - revised code from answer by @snr
          -3         Use t_function_3 - code from commentary by JL
          -4         Use t_function_4 - 'esoteric' code from commentary by JL

* `run.pth71.sh`

  Simple script to run pth71 5 times for each of variants 0-4.  Accepts -t,
  but that isn't all that helpful.

* `run.pth73.sh`

  Simple script to run pth73 5 times for each of variants 0-4, with the option
  of passing controls like `-c 15000 -w 5 -n 6` to the program.
