### Stack Overflow Question 4972-0718

[SO 4972-0718](https://stackoverflow.com/q/49720718) &mdash;
How to control mutex lock and unlock?

Various solutions were mooted and more or less acceptable solutions were
proposed.
ONe solution I proposed in comments turned out to have a typo in it (two
`pthread_mutex_lock()` calls on the same mutex, rather than one
`pthread_mutex_lock()` and one `pthread_mutex_unlock()`.
This code was assembled to create an answer covering and demonstrating
the various points.

The shell script is trivial â€” it simply runs the program `pth71` with
the argument `-0` five times, then with `-1`, ..., `-4`, to test each
algorithm five times.

The results recorded in my answer are quite interesting:

It was gratifying to see the first variant 1 result.
The variant 0 ones are intriguing, especially the third result.
