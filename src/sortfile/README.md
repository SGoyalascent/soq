### `sortfile1` and `sortfile2`

Two variants of how to sort lines from a file.  The `sortfile1` version
is limited to 1000 lines maximum; the `sortfile2` version allocates line
pointers as needed.

I couldn't identify which SO question these provide an answer to.  There
was such a question; the comments indicate that there was an incorrect
answer and this code was written to demonstrate that.  But the Git
history is silent on the details.
