### Sort test harness

Timing a number of different sort algorithms:

* Quick
* Bubble
* Insertion
* Selection

With different sizes of data set, with differently shaped data sets.

* Uniform
* Random
* Ascending
* Descending
* Forward Organ Pipe
* Reverse Organ Pipe

Different Fillers:

* Random Module
* Sawtooth
* Stagger
* Plateau
* Shuffle

With extra treatments:

* Full plain
* Full reversed
* 1st Half reversed
* 2nd Half reversed
* Full dithered

The code is instrumented to count comparisons and swaps.

It is not clear which SO question this was genated for.  There are also
derivatives of this in the private Sorting directory on home machines.
These include multiple variations on the quicksort algorithm (especially
the choice of partitioning).
